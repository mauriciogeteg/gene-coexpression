# Sugarcane dataset for co-expression analysis
Dataset to assess gene co-expression for wild sugarcane Saccharum spontaneum AP85-441.

Each file contains a matrix for co-expression analysis at gene-level. That means, the allele specific expression was consolidated for each representative gene. We shared the matrix using the identifiers of 2018 and 2019 versions of the genome.

Enjoy it!
