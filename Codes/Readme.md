# Python codes for gene-expression analysis

These Python codes consolidates expression matrices at the gene level using the allele-level information for genome. In this case, we used it for cultivar AP85-441 of sugarcane. 
More specifically, The first code is an optimization matching algorithm to maximize global identity while ensuring that data was not duplicated. The other ones are useful to consolidate the expression values from the allele to the gene level. 
These Python codes are available for the community, so that further enrichment analysis can be performed on sugarcane as well as on other organisms.

Enjoy it!
